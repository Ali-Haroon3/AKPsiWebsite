                        <p class="content">
                            Recruitment is a series of events that gives potential candidates the opportunity learn more about Alpha Kappa Psi. In turn, it also allows the active brothers to know more about interested applicants. Our first two events of Recruitment (Informational Session and Meet & Greet) are open to everyone, and prospective candidates are highly encouraged to attend at least one Informational Session of their choice and required to attend the Meet & Greet. At the conclusion of open recruitment, a select group of potential new members will be invited back for one or more events (Casual Night & Speed Dating) and may subsequently be offered an interview. The interview will feel very similar to a job interview and is an opportunity for potential new members to present themselves in a professional setting. Lastly, if our chapter feels that you are a good fit, we will offer you a bid.

                            Yes! Most of our brothers are actively involved on campus within other student organizations. It is even possible to be a member of a social fraternity/sorority as well as Alpha Kappa Psi. However, you cannot be in another organization under the Professional Fraternity Council.

You will have the opportunity to build meaningful, life-long friendships that will make a large campus like CU feel more like home.
